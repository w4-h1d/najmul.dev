Greetings! I'm Najmul Huda (22), a Bangladeshi Resident living in Sultanate of Oman with my parents. We are a family of five. My father is a Steel Workshop owner and my mother is a teacher. My elder brother has completed his Bachelor's of Business Administration Degree in Bangladesh and is now doing a job in a local company. And my younger sister is in Grade 9 in a Private School. All of us live together in a rented house. After paying for all the family expenditure, my parents are unable to afford the cost of higher education in Oman. The minimum cost of getting a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in Oman is about 25,000 US Dollars, which is  unaffordable for my parents. 

It is my dream to become a Software Engineer, which is one of the lucrative field at the moment. I'm good at solving problems. I like to learn how computers and technology works. Fortunately and by God's will, I have access to stable Internet Connection. So, I was able to complete a series of Introductory Courses on Computer Science provided my Harvard's CS50 Program and get the completion certificates (https://cs50.harvard.edu/certificates/c12f30ce-d15d-4e87-9e70-f455046cc45f , https://cs50.harvard.edu/certificates/427c802f-a621-482c-b89f-76a46957a43e). After getting introduced to Computer Science, I want to deep dive into Computer Science to learn more in details about all the processes and ultimately become a Software Engineer. I want to build softwares that will change people's lives. Through CS50 and various online courses, I have gained some basic knowledge about programing and problem solving. I have published a Browser Extension  (https://salah-time.com) which has a few hundrends of active users, though it is not generating any sort of income for me. I have also published my very own website (https://najmul.dev). In order to get a software engineering role, I have to further develop my foundational knowledge and skill. Companies in many region requires a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in order to get a role as a Software Engineer.
