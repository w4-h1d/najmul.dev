I'm Najmul Huda (22), a Bangladeshi residing in Oman with my parents. We are a family of five. All of us live together in a rented house. The minimum cost of getting a Bachelor's Degree in CS in Oman is 25,000 US Dollars. After paying for all the family expenditure, my parents are unable to afford higher education in Oman.

I have completed my high school with a GPA of 4.50 out of 5.00 in Science group under the National Curriculum of Bangladesh in 2022 (https://everify.dhakaeducationboard.gov.bd/cert?k=0702935836-f6abf0f634bfb3c6033cad94d49369c531b011677e339a98e18fa9cf0f573135). 

Due to my financial insolvency and unemployment, I am unable to pay 160 USD assessment fee. It took me over a month to pay my Application fee of 60 USD. I earn about 100 USD per month. So, I can pay 40 USD (25%) per courses.

Therefore, I respectfully request consideration of a scholarship would cover 75% of the course assessment fee, allowing me to pay the remaining 25% from my modest income.
